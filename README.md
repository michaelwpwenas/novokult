# NOVOKULT [PORTAL]

Revolutionize the portal, socialize the people.

The dashboard comes with its own built in KPIs, and it's forked from this GitHub repository:

# KPIs

1. Labor-Value Ratio (LVR) - A Metric for Socially Beneficial Worker-Investor Economies

The LVR is computed by dividing the total value generated by the labor and investments of worker-investors by the total labor hours expended.

`LVR = (Total Labor-Value + Total Investment-Value) / Total Labor Hours`

The LVR takes into account both the labor input and the investments made by workers to determine the value generated by their collective efforts. By utilizing this metric, societies can evaluate and optimize their economic systems to promote equitable outcomes for all participants.

2. Cooperative Climate Resilience Index (CCRI) - Evaluating Climate Consciousness in Investment Cooperatives

The CCRI is derived from the weighted aggregation of indicators that encompass environmental, social, and economic dimensions specific to investment cooperatives. Each indicator is assigned a weight based on its significance and relevance to the cooperative's climate consciousness.

`CCRI = (Σ (Indicator Value * Indicator Weight)) / Total Weight`

The Cooperative Climate Resilience Index (CCRI) is a metric designed to assess the climate consciousness of investment cooperatives. Acknowledging the unique characteristics of cooperative structures, the CCRI considers environmental, social, and economic factors to evaluate the cooperative's commitment to addressing climate change.

3. Integrated Metric for Sustainable Worker-Investor Cooperatives (IMS-WIC)

The IMS-WIC is calculated by aggregating the scores from the LVR and CCRI, assigning appropriate weights to each metric to reflect their relative importance.

`IMS-WIC = (LVR Score * LVR Weight) + (CCRI Score * CCRI Weight)`

This integrated metric aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation framework for worker-investor cooperatives, considering both their economic performance and their commitment to climate consciousness. By incorporating the LVR and CCRI, the IMS-WIC promotes a balanced and sustainable approach to cooperative development, ensuring equitable outcomes for workers and a positive impact on the environment.
